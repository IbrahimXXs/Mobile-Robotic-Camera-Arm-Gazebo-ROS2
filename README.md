# Mobile Robot Camera/Arm

## Overview

#### *This project is focused on creating a simulated environment for a mobile base robotic arm and a mobile robot equipped with a mounted camera. The simulation is powered by Gazebo and ROS2, providing a realistic testing ground for robotic applications.*

#### Concepts Used:

* In the development of this project, several key concepts and technologies were utilized:

* URDF with XML Coding: The robot structures were defined using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) with XML coding. This includes the definition of links, joints, inertia properties, and collision models.

* Xacro Manipulation: Xacro was employed to enhance XML coding capabilities. It allows for more advanced and modular manipulation of URDF files, simplifying the representation of robot models.

* TFs (Transforms) & TF Tree: The project incorporates the use of TFs to manage coordinate transforms between different parts of the robot. The TF tree illustrates the spatial relationships within the robot, providing a foundation for accurate sensor data interpretation and control.

* RViz2 Integration: RViz2, a 3D visualization tool for ROS2, is integrated into the project. It serves as a valuable tool for visualizing the robot model, TFs, and sensor data, aiding in debugging and understanding the robot's state.

#### Dependencies:

To run and test this project, you'll need the following dependencies installed:

* ROS2: Installation Guide
